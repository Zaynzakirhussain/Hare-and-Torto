A long time ago there was a hare who wouldn’t stop teasing a tortoise for his slowness. 
“I’m the fastest runner in the woods and you are the slowest one! We should compete!” he jeered.
One day the tortoise, tired of the hare showing off, agreed to have a running competition.
“You may be fast, but I am persistent”, he said.
The next day the tortoise and the hare stood at the start, ready for the race.
“One, two, three, go”, said the hare and they started running.
When he had finished his breakfast, the hare looked around to see how far the tortoise had got. He still hadn’t passed halfway! Feeling sleepy after his snack, the hare thought to himself, “I will have a quick snooze now and when I wake up I will quickly run past the finish line.”
