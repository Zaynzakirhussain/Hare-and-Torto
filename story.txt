A long time ago there was a hare who wouldn’t stop teasing a tortoise for his slowness. 
“I’m the fastest runner in the woods and you are the slowest one! We should compete!” he jeered.
One day the tortoise, tired of the hare showing off, agreed to have a running competition.
“You may be fast, but I am persistent”, he said.
